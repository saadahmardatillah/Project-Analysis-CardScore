**Business Problem Understanding**

Many individuals face difficulties obtaining loans due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories. A financial institution strives to enhance financial inclusion for the unbanked population by offering a positive and secure borrowing experience. To ensure that this underserved group has a beneficial loan experience, the institution utilizes various alternative data to predict clients' repayment capabilities. This approach ensures that capable clients are not denied loans and that the loans provided have appropriate principal amounts, maturities, and repayment schedules, thereby empowering clients to succeed.

**Objectives**

This project aims to reduce the rejection of creditworthy clients by:

1. Identifying characteristics of clients who face difficulties in repaying loans.
2. Developing a predictive model to accurately assess clients' repayment abilities.

**Methodology**

**A. Data Preparation**

1. Source: Data obtained from project based learning

2. Actions: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis to ensure high-quality inputs for the model.

**B. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

1. Purpose: To discover patterns, spot anomalies, and gain a deeper understanding of the data's characteristics.

2. Techniques: Visualization, summary statistics, and correlation analysis to identify significant features.
Machine Learning

**C. Machine Learning**

1. Goal: Build models to predict clients' repayment capabilities.

2. Approach: 6 algorithms were evaluated to determine the best prediction model.

**D. Tools**

1. Programming Language: Python

2. Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

**Results**

The analysis showed that the Random Forest model was the best at predicting clients' ability to repay, with an impressive 99% accuracy. This model allows for precise and dependable decisions, ensuring that creditworthy clients get approved and receive loan terms that are right for them. This ultimately helps them repay successfully and achieve financial stability.

**Future Work**

1. Model Improvement: Explore more advanced machine learning algorithms and feature engineering techniques to improve model accuracy.

2. Broader Application: Extend the analysis to other aspects of loan approval, such as loan terms and customer segmentation, to further enhance the approval process.
